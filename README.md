# Summary

This package encodes the Reciprocal-Practice-Skill (RPS) model of free learning. It includes the python code of the base model. The *notebooks* folder contains a few jupyter notebooks which show how to use different package classes and methods to simulate single and multiple learner simulations according to the RPS model. Sensitivity analysis of different parameters are also provided, along with extensions incorporating spacing effects and the effect of deadlines. This package is still a work in progress and more detailed documentation will be added later. 

To start off, check out our 2024 Cog-Sci conference paper [here](https://escholarship.org/uc/item/98s6q1bc) which explains the basic model. The *Basic Model Analysis.ipynb* file in the *notebooks* folder reproduces the figures from the conference paper.
