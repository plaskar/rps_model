# Summary
This package encodes the Reciprocal-Practice-Skill (RPS) model of free learning. It includes the python code of the base model. The *notebooks* folder contains jupyter notebooks which describe how to use different package classes and methods to simulate single and multiple learner simulations according to the RPS model. Sensitivity analysis of different parameters are also provided, along with extensions incorporating spacing effects and the effect of deadlines.
